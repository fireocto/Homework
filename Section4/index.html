    <h2>How You Do It</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the water to 180F. Take off the heat and mix in your DME, making sure it is completely dissolved. You have now created wort!</li>
      <li>Place pot back on the heat and bring to a boil.</li>
      <li>Once the wort is up to a boil, follow this hopping schedule:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>0.5oz CTZ - 60</li>
          <li>1oz Amarillo - 30</li>
          <li>1oz Citra - 5</li>
          <li>1oz each Citra and Amarillo - 0</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Once the 60 minute boil is over, cool the wort to 67F.</li>
      <li>Now that the wort is cool, pitch your yeast of choice and make sure it gets completely rehydrated.</li>
      <li>Store is a cool, dark place for 7-10 days.</li>
      <li>Once fermentation is complete, package your beer, carbonate it to 2.5 volumes, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
